# stream-questions

Note: this project has been replaced by [Form Questions](https://github.com/mtoohey31/form-questions), which does the same things, just better!

Combination of (badly made) react frontend that can be added as a webpage source in OBS and python backend that can pull questions from a Google Sheet.
